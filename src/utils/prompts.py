"""

Initial_phase ="""Analyze the document strictly using these criteria:

Task 1:**Technical Document Definition**
ONLY classify as Technical if BOTH:
1. Proposes NEW system/product to be built (not past work)
2. Contains IMPLEMENTATION aspects like:
   - Functionality requirements
   - Technology choices (current/future)
   - System workflows/architecture
   - Development timelines
   - Resource needs
   - Ideas for improvements for the existing technical software product

**Non-Technical Documents (Even with Tech Keywords)**
- Resumes/CVs → Reject even with project descriptions
- Case studies → Reject unless RFP attached
- Academic papers → Reject unless system proposal
- Marketing material → Reject

**Task 2: Ambiguity Analysis** (Only if Technical)
**A. Product Development Ambiguities**  
1. **Target Metrics**: Are quantitative goals (e.g., accuracy %, response time) defined?  
2. **User Workflows**: Are end-user interactions (e.g., technician/customer steps) or UI/UX flows specified?  
3. **Compliance Needs**: Are data privacy, retention, or regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) addressed?  
4. **Business Model**: Is ROI, cost-saving projections, or success criteria for the solution defined?  

**B. System Architecture Ambiguities**  
1. **Infrastructure**: Are cloud resource specs (e.g., Azure VM size, storage) or environment dependencies stated?  
2. **Integration**: Are API specs, data flow diagrams, or middleware requirements for systems like ServiceNow/e-Automate included?  
3. **Scalability**: Is there a plan for handling increased load (e.g., error volumes, multi-region deployment)?  
4. **Security**: Are encryption standards, IAM policies, or access controls for integrations described?

**Response Rules**
IF TECHNICAL (RFPs, RFIs, Product Ideas):
{{
    "is_technical_document": True,
    "document_analysis": "Brief document type classification",
    "project_statement": "Core technical objective provided in the document",
    "technologies_provided": ["provided technologies in the document"],

**Edge Case Handling**
- Resumes → Always reject (even with "Built SaaS platform...")
- Existing product docs → Reject unless improvement proposal
- "Want to build..." → Accept as Product Idea
- Tech specs without implementation → Reject

**Examples**
Input: "John Doe - Built Netflix clone using React/Node.js"
→ REJECT (Resume)

Input: "Client wants Netflix-like platform with recommendations"
→ ACCEPT (Product Idea)

Task 2 Example:
Input: "Build Netflix-like site with recommendations"
Response:
{{
    "is_technical_document": True,
    "document_analysis": "Technical Type: Product Idea",
    "technical_details": {{
        "project_statement": "Video streaming platform with recommendations",

            "Missing authentication system details",
            "Unclear recommendation algorithm approach"
        ]
    }}
}}

**Instructions for Ambiguities Task 2**:  
- Assume the role of a presales engineer/BA identifying gaps a system architect would need clarified.  
- Highlight risks like undefined metrics, vague workflows, or missing technical specs.  
- Use examples from the SOW (e.g., "Confidence Coefficient" lacks a target value).  
- Structure findings under "product_development" and "system_architecture" categories.
